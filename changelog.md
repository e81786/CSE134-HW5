# Changelog

I started adding javascript to my website by changing some functionality that I wanted in my website from the very beginning.
I added some accordian tags in the about section of my website, under Skill, Hobbies, and Extras. I made it so they have the functionality of sliding out and and sliding back in as well. In addition, I made it so the arrow changes based on whether the panel is shifted out or its hidden. In each of the accordian tags, I added a lot more of the things I wanted to add to about section so people can see a little more about me as a person! 

Furthermore, I added smooth scrolling jumps for the links of my website. Specifically in the header and the footer, pressing the different links will now scroll smoothly to the tag they need to be at instead of instant jumps.

For my 3rd party Javascript, I decided to add Google Analytics tracking to my website. I think this was the most interesting and necessary because the other one's didn't seem very useful for me, but Google Analytics was a lot more practical as I could see what kind of things people would be looking at one my page.
