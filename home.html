          <p>
            Hi there! My name is <span>Eric Dong</span>. I'm currently a
            student at UC San Diego, studying
            <strong>Cognitive Science</strong> with an emphasis in
            <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, and a minor chunk of
            <strong>Computer Science</strong> on the side. I'm originally from
            the San Francisco Bay Area but more recently, you can find me in
            the San Diego area: studying, swimming, hanging with my
            fellowship, or coding!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As a software engineer excited to gain more experience in the
            professional scene, I'm constantly looking to grow and hone my
            skills, and I can't wait to see where the journey <span class=qjump>lands</span> me
            next!

          <ul>
            <li>Object Oriented Programming
              <p>
                I have learned a variety of languages such as Java, Python, and C++, and I've taken classes and done
                various projects in different languages.
              </p>

            <li>Web Client Languages
              <p>
                HTML, CSS, Javascript
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Other Programming Languages
              <p>
                C
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Data Structures
              <p>
                e.g. Bloom Filters, Multiway Tries, Minimum Spanning Trees, Huffman Coding Trees, Aho-Corasick
                Automaton, Graphs
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Analysis of Algorithms
              <p>
                e.g. Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS), Divide and Conquer, Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Soft Skills</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Conflict Resolution
              <p>
                Working as a referee and a lifeguard taught me a lot about dealing with angry or even just upset adults
                and kids, and how not to panic when unexpected variables pop up.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Leadership
              <p>
                In high school and college, I've thankfully been able to be in a lot of positions of leadership, whether
                it be leading a small group of people, working and managing a group project, or even being a significant
                officer of a larger club. There's a lot of humility to be learnt in leadership, but I also learned to
                communicate more clearly and effectively.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Work-Life Balance
              <p>
                I've made a lot of timing mistakes in college, but thankfully I've learned to fix a lot of my previous
                attitudes in having too much work or too much fun. Throughout college, I've learned to balance my time
                accordingly, to finish everything I need to and I want to finish in a timely, yet stress-free way.
              </p>

          <span class="rightarrow"></span>Hobbies
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <ul>
            <li>Sports
              <p>
                I've been a swimmer as long as I can remember, starting from my mom throwing me in the pool from a
                really young age, to competing in varsity swim and club swim all throughout my high school career. Swim
                is an amazing way to have fun and relax, while still keeping fit and competitive. In college now, I try
                to swim when I can to get a hit of nostalgia, but also just to relax on a stressful day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, my friends have also really encouraged and helped me enjoy playing many different sports. Even
                though I learned a lot of sports when I was little (e.g. tennis, baseball, basketball, taekwondo, kung
                fu, volleyball, etc), I never really enjoyed them too much. However, now I am able to enjoy the
                recreational games of volleyball, pickleball, tennis, and soccer with my friends.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Instruments
              <p>
                As many of my friends, I grew up playing violin and piano. However, in a bout of inspiration (and
                frankly out of a frustration in playing piano), I switched over to cello in the 4th grade. From then on,
                until playing cello in Washington DC with my middle school orchestra and playing in Disneyland CA with
                my high school orchestra, I have throughly enjoyed the deep, vibrant tones the cello plays out.
              </p>
              <p>
                Recently, I've decided to switch over to a more accessible and versatile instrument, the guitar. It's
                been a joy trying to pick up a new instrument and seeing real improvement in my practice. I get to play
                with my friends as we jam to worship songs and enjoy music as it was designed to be.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Music
              <p>
                Outside of playing music, I really enjoy listening and even singing along with music. Karaoke has always
                been a preferred pasttime, but even without singing, I enjoy having music playing in my ears and
                enjoying the bops from my curated playlists. I've listened to large variety of genres over the years,
                and my taste has changed a lot, even diving into Musicals for a while. However, some of my favorite
                artists include Keshi, AKMU, and Sovereign Grace Music.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Friends and Clubs
              <p>
                My community is a big part of what gives me joy and life, and hanging out with my friends is such a
                blessing to have during college. I spend much of my time with my church, Lighthouse Bible Church, and
                the many college studnets that populate the college group. However, I spend even more time with the
                fellowship I serve in, Asian American Christian Fellowship, and we enjoy a large variety of activities
                together!
